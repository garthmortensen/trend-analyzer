### Trend Analysis Summary 

**Objective**: Analyzing period-over-period trends (2023 vs. 2024) in health insurance claims data to identify key cost drivers, utilization patterns, anomalies, and actionable insights. 

### Findings:

1. **High-Level Trends Across Years (2023 vs 2024)**:
   - The high-level trend data indicates overall claims costs and counts tracked year-over-year.

   **Data Saved**: [High-level trend data for claims by year (2023-2024)](output_data/20251119_200425_data.csv)

2. **Major Service Categories**:
   - Claims were categorized into various major service categories (e.g., Radiology, Evaluation & Management). Radiology showed significant costs and utilization changes.

   **Data Saved**: [Trends in claims costs by major service category (2023-2024)](output_data/20251119_200429_data.csv)

3. **State-Specific Claims Data**:
   - The data revealed state-specific trends, highlighting states with notable claims costs and utilization patterns.
   
   **Data Saved**: [Claims data by state (2023-2024)](output_data/20251119_200434_data.csv)

4. **Costs by Conditions**:
   - The analysis of costs by condition revealed that certain conditions like Pneumonia and Diabetes had high associated costs, which merits further investigation.

   **Data Saved**: [Claim costs by condition (2023-2024)](output_data/20251119_200439_data.csv)

### Next Steps for Detailed Insights:

- **Deep Dive into High-Cost Service Categories**: Identify the top conditions driving costs within major service categories and compare these with 2023 figures.
- **Evaluate Trends by Age Group & Gender**: Analyze how demographic factors like age group and gender affect claims costs and utilization patterns.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Investigate any outliers or unusual spikes in claims costs for specific procedures across states or demographic segments.

### Recommendations:

- **Cost Management Strategies**: For rising costs associated with specific high-cost conditions, consider implementing targeted wellness programs, preventative care initiatives, or risk management strategies.
- **Utilization Review**: Regularly monitor utilization rates for specific services that are driving costs to ensure they align with care quality and patient outcomes.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Leverage the insights from claims data to inform network contracting negotiations and program development aimed at reducing unnecessary spending while improving patient care quality.

This analysis leverages comprehensive claims data to highlight actionable strategies, which can be further refined as additional insights are gathered.
