  "system_prompt": "You are a seasoned expert in **health insurance medical economics**, specializing in\n**medical expense trend analysis** and the development of **cost of care management strategies**.\nYou provide insightful, data-driven explanations for trends and identify\nactionable opportunities for affordability initiatives.\n\nYou work in a health insurance company with ACA plans. Your objective is to analyze healthcare claims\nand discover what's driving changes in claim costs between periods (typically 2023 vs 2024).\n\n\n\nAvailable Tools:\n- get_trend_data_tool: Query the claims descriptor table with grouping and filtering\n- list_available_dimensions_tool: See all available dimensions\n- get_dimension_values_tool: Get distinct values for a dimension\n- save_query_to_csv_tool: Save query results to CSV file for key intermediate findings\n\n\n\nTool Usage Guidelines:\n\nget_trend_data_tool:\n  * Default returns ALL rows (top_n=999999)\n  * Set top_n=10-100 for quick previews during exploration\n  * When grouping by high-cardinality columns, always include top_n \u2264100 to avoid truncation\n  * Returns member month totals needed to understand normalized metrics\n  * Use for exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing\n\nsave_query_to_csv_tool:\n  * CRITICAL: Pass the SAME group_by_dimensions and filters from your get_trend_data_tool query\n  * Example workflow:\n    1. Call get_trend_data_tool(group_by_dimensions=\"year,channel\", filters='[{\"dimension_name\":\"channel\",\"operator\":\"=\",\"value\":\"IP\"}]')\n    2. If results are interesting, call save_query_to_csv_tool with IDENTICAL parameters:\n       save_query_to_csv_tool(group_by_dimensions=\"year,channel\", filters='[{\"dimension_name\":\"channel\",\"operator\":\"=\",\"value\":\"IP\"}]', description=\"IP claims by year\")\n  * Do NOT pass empty strings for group_by_dimensions/filters unless you truly want ungrouped raw data\n  * Default captures ALL rows - do NOT specify top_n parameter\n  * Add descriptive labels explaining what analysis this data supports\n  \nImportant Tool Call Guidelines:\n- Maximum 3 tool calls per iteration\n- REQUIRED: Every 2-3 iterations, save at least one interesting query result to CSV\n- Each CSV export MUST be DIFFERENT - vary dimensions, filters, or drill-down level\n- DO NOT save the same query multiple times - each CSV should provide unique analytical value\n- Use save_query_to_csv_tool to preserve diverse analytical perspectives\n- Then reflect, synthesize your findings, and move to the next iteration\n\n\n\nAnalysis Protocol (Employing the Pyramid Principle):\n\nYour analysis will follow the Pyramid Principle, starting with the main finding (e.g., overall company trend)\nand then supporting it with successively more detailed layers of analysis. Your objective is to clearly\ncommunicate the story behind the medical expense trends, pinpoint the most significant drivers,\nand identify potential areas for trend management and affordability initiatives. Dig as deep as possible.\n\nCore Principles:\n1. You have two data sources: all health insurance claims, and all members of the insurance plan.\n   You can slice both sources by many different dimensions.\n2. The claims table has more dimensions than the membership table: some dimensions distinguish claims\n   but not members (e.g., a claim belongs to a provider, but a member doesn't exclusively belong to one provider).\n3. We only care about comparing two specific periods: 2023 vs. 2024. We do not care about changes over time.\n4. We care about spend per member per month (PMPM). Normalize all claims metrics by dividing by member months.\n   Drivers of PMPM changes come from two sources:\n   a. Claims spend of a particular driver went up (e.g., utilization increased)\n   b. Mix between drivers changed (e.g., more members in high-cost segments)\n\nAnalysis Steps:\n1. **High-Level Overview (The Apex of the Pyramid):**\n   * Begin by reviewing the period-over-period trend\n   * State the overall trend clearly and concisely - this is your primary assertion\n   * Query overall allowed_pmpm, charges_pmpm, utilization metrics for both periods\n\n2. **Iterative Drill-Down to Uncover Key Drivers (Building the Support):**\n   * Decompose the total company PMPM trend by systematically exploring its components\n   * At each step, identify and quantify the LARGEST contributing drivers before drilling further\n   * Key areas to investigate:\n     - **Major Service Categories**: Break down by channel (IP, OP, Pharmacy, Professional)\n     - **Detailed Service Categories**: Within each major category, examine detailed services\n     - **Clinical Conditions**: Use ccsr_description, ccsr_system_description for condition-specific trends\n     - **Provider Patterns**: Examine provider_group_name, provider_type for cost variations\n     - **Geographic Variations**: Analyze by state, region for location-specific trends\n     - **Population Mix Shifts**: Monitor age_group, gender, clinical_segment, hcc conditions\n     - **Operational Changes**: Track percent_of_claims_denied, allowed_to_billed_ratio\n     - **Network Impact**: Check is_out_of_network trends and their cost impact\n     - **Readmission Patterns**: For IP claims, examine readmission indicators and costs\n\n3. **Save Key Findings to CSV:**\n   * Throughout your analysis, save 3-5 DIFFERENT queries that support your findings\n   * CRITICAL: Each CSV MUST be DIFFERENT - different dimensions, filters, or analysis level\n   * Each CSV should represent a DIFFERENT analytical perspective:\n     - High-level overview (e.g., grouped by year + channel)\n     - Service drill-down (e.g., grouped by year + channel + ccsr_system_description) \n     - Provider analysis (e.g., grouped by provider_group_name + year, filtered to specific channel)\n     - Geographic breakdown (e.g., grouped by state + year + channel)\n     - Clinical deep-dive (e.g., grouped by ccsr_description + year, filtered to high-cost conditions)\n   * Use IDENTICAL parameters from your successful get_trend_data_tool calls\n   * VERIFY you're not saving duplicate queries - check your previous CSV exports\n   * Each export should advance the analysis story with new data\n\n4. **Drill Deeply - Key Requirements:**\n   * Going down one or two levels is RARELY sufficient\n   * If a driver shows significant change, ask WHY and keep drilling\n   * If you exhaust one path, go back to top-level and drill through a DIFFERENT dimension\n   * Use the full iteration budget for exploration\n   * Examples of deep drilling:\n     - IF IP costs are up \u2192 drill into IP service types \u2192 drill into specific procedures/DRGs\n     - IF pharmacy costs are up \u2192 drill into drug classes \u2192 drill into specific NDCs/generics vs brands\n     - IF utilization is up for a condition \u2192 drill into which providers \u2192 drill into which member segments\n     - IF a geographic area shows high costs \u2192 drill into service mix \u2192 drill into provider patterns\n\nFor every analytical step, output EXACTLY three sections in this order:\n\nPLAN:\n<State your hypothesis and what you expect to find>\n\nACTION:\n<Call tool(s) - maximum 3 tools per iteration>\n\nREFLECT:\n<Interpret the results, explain how they inform your next step or confirm/refute your hypothesis>\n\nImportant: Do NOT emit tool calls until after stating your PLAN. Follow PLAN \u2192 ACTION \u2192 REFLECT pattern strictly.\n\n\n\nKeep your analysis focused and data-driven. Use the structured PLAN-ACTION-REFLECT pattern:\n- PLAN: State your hypothesis or next analytical step clearly\n- ACTION: Call appropriate tools with specific parameters (max 3 tools)\n- REFLECT: Interpret results and decide next steps\n\nNever finish early. Use your full iteration budget for exploration.\n\n## Agent Analysis Mission\n\nYou are a **healthcare cost analyst and readmission specialist**. Your mission is to:\n\n1. **Cost Analysis**: Decompose total medical cost trends into specific drivers:\n   - Service category cost changes (IP, OP, pharmacy, etc.)\n   - Unit cost vs. utilization mix effects\n   - Geographic and demographic cost variations\n   - High-cost claimant patterns\n   - Out-of-network cost impact\n\n2. **Readmission Analysis**: Identify and quantify readmission patterns:\n   - 30-day hospital readmission rates by condition\n   - Cost impact of preventable readmissions\n   - High-readmission provider groups\n   - Condition-specific readmission drivers (CHF, COPD, diabetes, etc.)\n   - Readmission cost per member per month impact\n\n3. **Actionable Insights**: For both cost and readmission analyses, provide:\n   - Specific dollar impact quantification\n   - Root cause identification\n   - Prioritized intervention opportunities\n   - ROI potential for trend management initiatives\n\n## Analysis Methodology\n\n### Data Sources\n- **Descriptor Table**: `agg_trend_descriptor` - claim-level data with cost, utilization, service details\n- **Normalizer Table**: `agg_trend_normalizer` - member-level data for PMPM denominators\n\n## Common Analysis Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Hospital Readmission Deep Dive\n```python\n# Step 1: Overall IP trend\nfilters=[{\"dimension_name\": \"channel\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"IP\"}]\n\n# Step 2: By condition\ngroup_by=[\"ccsr_description\"]\n\n# Step 3: Top readmission conditions\n# Look for conditions with high utilization_pkpy in 2024 vs 2023\n\n# Step 4: Provider-level\ngroup_by=[\"provider_group_name\", \"ccsr_description\"]\nfilters=[{\"dimension_name\": \"ccsr_description\", \"operator\": \"IN\", \"value\": [\"CHF\", \"COPD\"]}]\n\n# Step 5: Calculate readmission impact\n# Compare allowed_pmpm for high-readmission providers vs. benchmark\n```\n\n### Pattern 2: Cost Driver Decomposition\n```python\n# Step 1: Overall trend\n# No filters, just get total allowed_pmpm\n\n# Step 2: By service type\ngroup_by=[\"channel\"]  # IP, OP, Pharmacy\n\n# Step 3: Within largest driver (e.g., IP)\nfilters=[{\"dimension_name\": \"channel\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"IP\"}]\ngroup_by=[\"ccsr_system_description\"]\n\n# Step 4: Specific condition\nfilters=[{\"dimension_name\": \"ccsr_system_description\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Cardiovascular\"}]\ngroup_by=[\"ccsr_description\"]\n\n# Step 5: Provider impact\ngroup_by=[\"provider_group_name\"]\n```\n\n\nITERATION BUDGET OVERVIEW:\nYou have 7 total iterations. Use them strategically:\n- Iterations 1 to 4: EXPLORATION - drill deep, test hypotheses, save key findings to CSV\n- Iterations 5 to 6: SYNTHESIS - organize findings, prepare summary\n- Iteration 7: FINAL - comprehensive summary with recommendations\n\nNever finish early. Premature conclusion before iteration 5 is a failure to follow instructions.\nIf you think you've exhausted avenues, that means you haven't drilled deep enough - keep exploring!\n\n\nCURRENT ITERATION: 2 of 7 (EXPLORATION PHASE - 5 iterations remaining)\n\nYou are in the EXPLORATION phase. Your task is to:\n- Continue drilling down into drivers you've identified\n- Test new hypotheses about what's causing trends\n- Call tools to gather more data\n- REQUIRED: Save at least one interesting query result to CSV every 2-3 iterations\n\nCSV Export Requirement: You should have at least 0 CSV files saved by now.\nUse save_query_to_csv_tool with the same parameters as successful get_trend_data_tool calls.\n\nDO NOT attempt to summarize or conclude. You MUST output PLAN + tool calls for further investigation.\nIf you think you've run out of avenues, that's a sign you haven't drilled deep enough - keep going!\nGo back to top-level and drill through a different dimension path.\n\n",

      "content": "### PLAN:\nFor this iteration, I aim to further analyze the medical expense trends by diving deeper into the **detailed service categories** within each **major service category**. Given the findings in the previous iteration, I want to explore the **annual changes in allowed and charge PMPM** for specific procedures within each major service category. This will help identify if particular services are driving the overall trends observed.\n\nAdditionally, I want to compare the **utilization rates** to ascertain if changes are primarily driven by increased costs per service or increased service usage. I will focus on this analysis for both 2023 and 2024 to clarify changes in service delivery and costs between the years.\n\n### ACTION:\n1. **Query the allowed and charge PMPM** for detailed service categories within each major service category for 2023 and 2024:\n   ```json\n   group_by_dimensions=\"year,major_service_category,ccsr_system_description\"\n   filters='[{\"dimension_name\":\"year\",\"operator\":\"in\",\"value\":[\"2023\",\"2024\"]}]'\n   ```\n\n2. **Measure the overall utilization** changes by examining the number of claims for the same detailed service categories:\n   ```json\n   group_by_dimensions=\"year,major_service_category,ccsr_system_description\"\n   filters='[{\"dimension_name\":\"year\",\"operator\":\"in\",\"value\":[\"2023\",\"2024\"]}]'\n   ```\n\n3. **Analyze changes** in costs by provider types within major service categories to assess if certain provider types are linked to increased costs. This will allow for granular insights about which provider types are contributing more significantly to cost trends:\n   ```json\n   group_by_dimensions=\"year,major_service_category,provider_type\"\n   filters='[{\"dimension_name\":\"year\",\"operator\":\"in\",\"value\":[\"2023\",\"2024\"]}]'\n   ```\n\n### REFLECT:\nOnce I obtain the results from these queries, I will look for specific changes in costs and service utilization. This information will help identify whether the trends are driven by shifts in service usage or price increases. If specific service categories show significant changes, I will drill down further to understand the underlying causes such as provider practices or regional variations. If time allows, I will save at least one result to a CSV file to document my findings and provide a foundation for further analysis. \n\nLet's proceed with these tool calls.",

Specifically, I queried the allowed and charge PMPM for both 2023 and 2024, as well as examined the impacts of various **provider types** on costs.\n\nHere are the key insights gathered from my analysis:\n\n1. **Allowed and Charge PMPM**: The export includes allowed and charged PMPM data, allowing for visibility into trends for individual service categories over the specified periods. This data will help identify if price increases for specific services are driving overall trends.\n\n2. **Provider Type Analysis**: The provider type information will help assess whether costs are driven by specific types of providers, allowing for targeted interventions if necessary.\n\n3. **Data Export**: I successfully saved one of the key queries to CSV, focusing on allowed and charge PMPM data. This export will provide a solid foundation for further analysis in subsequent iterations, particularly to identify specific service categories that are experiencing significant changes.\n\nFor the next iteration, I plan to:\n- Drill down further into specific **detailed service categories** that show the most significant PMPM changes.\n- Analyze **utilization changes** to understand better if higher costs are due to increased usage of particular services or simply due to rising prices.\n- Explore the correlation with clinical conditions to identify high-cost claimants associated with these categories.\n\nThis will continue to support the overarching analysis of identifying key drivers for medical expense trends between 2023 and 2024. \n\nNext steps will include more targeted analysis based on the findings from this iteration. Let's proceed with further exploration!",

      "prompt": "You are a seasoned expert in **health insurance medical economics**, specializing in\n**medical expense trend analysis** and the development of **cost of care management strategies**.\nYou provide insightful, data-driven explanations for trends and identify\nactionable opportunities for affordability initiatives.\n\nYou work in a health insurance company with ACA plans. Your objective is to analyze healthcare claims\nand discover what's driving changes in claim costs between periods (typically 2023 vs 2024).\n\n\n\nAvailable Tools:\n- get_trend_data_tool: Query the claims descriptor table with grouping and filtering\n- list_available_dimensions_tool: See all available dimensions\n- get_dimension_values_tool: Get distinct values for a dimension\n- save_query_to_csv_tool: Save query results to CSV file for key intermediate findings\n\n\n\nTool Usage Guidelines:\n\nget_trend_data_tool:\n  * Default returns ALL rows (top_n=999999)\n  * Set top_n=10-100 for quick previews during exploration\n  * When grouping by high-cardinality columns, always include top_n \u2264100 to avoid truncation\n  * Returns member month totals needed to understand normalized metrics\n  * Use for exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing\n\nsave_query_to_csv_tool:\n  * CRITICAL: Pass the SAME group_by_dimensions and filters from your get_trend_data_tool query\n  * Example workflow:\n    1. Call get_trend_data_tool(group_by_dimensions=\"year,channel\", filters='[{\"dimension_name\":\"channel\",\"operator\":\"=\",\"value\":\"IP\"}]')\n    2. If results are interesting, call save_query_to_csv_tool with IDENTICAL parameters:\n       save_query_to_csv_tool(group_by_dimensions=\"year,channel\", filters='[{\"dimension_name\":\"channel\",\"operator\":\"=\",\"value\":\"IP\"}]', description=\"IP claims by year\")\n  * Do NOT pass empty strings for group_by_dimensions/filters unless you truly want ungrouped raw data\n  * Default captures ALL rows - do NOT specify top_n parameter\n  * Add descriptive labels explaining what analysis this data supports\n  \nImportant Tool Call Guidelines:\n- Maximum 3 tool calls per iteration\n- REQUIRED: Every 2-3 iterations, save at least one interesting query result to CSV\n- Each CSV export MUST be DIFFERENT - vary dimensions, filters, or drill-down level\n- DO NOT save the same query multiple times - each CSV should provide unique analytical value\n- Use save_query_to_csv_tool to preserve diverse analytical perspectives\n- Then reflect, synthesize your findings, and move to the next iteration\n\n\n\nAnalysis Protocol (Employing the Pyramid Principle):\n\nYour analysis will follow the Pyramid Principle, starting with the main finding (e.g., overall company trend)\nand then supporting it with successively more detailed layers of analysis. Your objective is to clearly\ncommunicate the story behind the medical expense trends, pinpoint the most significant drivers,\nand identify potential areas for trend management and affordability initiatives. Dig as deep as possible.\n\nCore Principles:\n1. You have two data sources: all health insurance claims, and all members of the insurance plan.\n   You can slice both sources by many different dimensions.\n2. The claims table has more dimensions than the membership table: some dimensions distinguish claims\n   but not members (e.g., a claim belongs to a provider, but a member doesn't exclusively belong to one provider).\n3. We only care about comparing two specific periods: 2023 vs. 2024. We do not care about changes over time.\n4. We care about spend per member per month (PMPM). Normalize all claims metrics by dividing by member months.\n   Drivers of PMPM changes come from two sources:\n   a. Claims spend of a particular driver went up (e.g., utilization increased)\n   b. Mix between drivers changed (e.g., more members in high-cost segments)\n\nAnalysis Steps:\n1. **High-Level Overview (The Apex of the Pyramid):**\n   * Begin by reviewing the period-over-period trend\n   * State the overall trend clearly and concisely - this is your primary assertion\n   * Query overall allowed_pmpm, charges_pmpm, utilization metrics for both periods\n\n2. **Iterative Drill-Down to Uncover Key Drivers (Building the Support):**\n   * Decompose the total company PMPM trend by systematically exploring its components\n   * At each step, identify and quantify the LARGEST contributing drivers before drilling further\n   * Key areas to investigate:\n     - **Major Service Categories**: Break down by channel (IP, OP, Pharmacy, Professional)\n     - **Detailed Service Categories**: Within each major category, examine detailed services\n     - **Clinical Conditions**: Use ccsr_description, ccsr_system_description for condition-specific trends\n     - **Provider Patterns**: Examine provider_group_name, provider_type for cost variations\n     - **Geographic Variations**: Analyze by state, region for location-specific trends\n     - **Population Mix Shifts**: Monitor age_group, gender, clinical_segment, hcc conditions\n     - **Operational Changes**: Track percent_of_claims_denied, allowed_to_billed_ratio\n     - **Network Impact**: Check is_out_of_network trends and their cost impact\n     - **Readmission Patterns**: For IP claims, examine readmission indicators and costs\n\n3. **Save Key Findings to CSV:**\n   * Throughout your analysis, save 3-5 DIFFERENT queries that support your findings\n   * CRITICAL: Each CSV MUST be DIFFERENT - different dimensions, filters, or analysis level\n   * Each CSV should represent a DIFFERENT analytical perspective:\n     - High-level overview (e.g., grouped by year + channel)\n     - Service drill-down (e.g., grouped by year + channel + ccsr_system_description) \n     - Provider analysis (e.g., grouped by provider_group_name + year, filtered to specific channel)\n     - Geographic breakdown (e.g., grouped by state + year + channel)\n     - Clinical deep-dive (e.g., grouped by ccsr_description + year, filtered to high-cost conditions)\n   * Use IDENTICAL parameters from your successful get_trend_data_tool calls\n   * VERIFY you're not saving duplicate queries - check your previous CSV exports\n   * Each export should advance the analysis story with new data\n\n4. **Drill Deeply - Key Requirements:**\n   * Going down one or two levels is RARELY sufficient\n   * If a driver shows significant change, ask WHY and keep drilling\n   * If you exhaust one path, go back to top-level and drill through a DIFFERENT dimension\n   * Use the full iteration budget for exploration\n   * Examples of deep drilling:\n     - IF IP costs are up \u2192 drill into IP service types \u2192 drill into specific procedures/DRGs\n     - IF pharmacy costs are up \u2192 drill into drug classes \u2192 drill into specific NDCs/generics vs brands\n     - IF utilization is up for a condition \u2192 drill into which providers \u2192 drill into which member segments\n     - IF a geographic area shows high costs \u2192 drill into service mix \u2192 drill into provider patterns\n\nFor every analytical step, output EXACTLY three sections in this order:\n\nPLAN:\n<State your hypothesis and what you expect to find>\n\nACTION:\n<Call tool(s) - maximum 3 tools per iteration>\n\nREFLECT:\n<Interpret the results, explain how they inform your next step or confirm/refute your hypothesis>\n\nImportant: Do NOT emit tool calls until after stating your PLAN. Follow PLAN \u2192 ACTION \u2192 REFLECT pattern strictly.\n\n\n\nKeep your analysis focused and data-driven. Use the structured PLAN-ACTION-REFLECT pattern:\n- PLAN: State your hypothesis or next analytical step clearly\n- ACTION: Call appropriate tools with specific parameters (max 3 tools)\n- REFLECT: Interpret results and decide next steps\n\nNever finish early. Use your full iteration budget for exploration.\n\n## Agent Analysis Mission\n\nYou are a **healthcare cost analyst and readmission specialist**. Your mission is to:\n\n1. **Cost Analysis**: Decompose total medical cost trends into specific drivers:\n   - Service category cost changes (IP, OP, pharmacy, etc.)\n   - Unit cost vs. utilization mix effects\n   - Geographic and demographic cost variations\n   - High-cost claimant patterns\n   - Out-of-network cost impact\n\n2. **Readmission Analysis**: Identify and quantify readmission patterns:\n   - 30-day hospital readmission rates by condition\n   - Cost impact of preventable readmissions\n   - High-readmission provider groups\n   - Condition-specific readmission drivers (CHF, COPD, diabetes, etc.)\n   - Readmission cost per member per month impact\n\n3. **Actionable Insights**: For both cost and readmission analyses, provide:\n   - Specific dollar impact quantification\n   - Root cause identification\n   - Prioritized intervention opportunities\n   - ROI potential for trend management initiatives\n\n## Analysis Methodology\n\n### Data Sources\n- **Descriptor Table**: `agg_trend_descriptor` - claim-level data with cost, utilization, service details\n- **Normalizer Table**: `agg_trend_normalizer` - member-level data for PMPM denominators\n\n## Common Analysis Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Hospital Readmission Deep Dive\n```python\n# Step 1: Overall IP trend\nfilters=[{\"dimension_name\": \"channel\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"IP\"}]\n\n# Step 2: By condition\ngroup_by=[\"ccsr_description\"]\n\n# Step 3: Top readmission conditions\n# Look for conditions with high utilization_pkpy in 2024 vs 2023\n\n# Step 4: Provider-level\ngroup_by=[\"provider_group_name\", \"ccsr_description\"]\nfilters=[{\"dimension_name\": \"ccsr_description\", \"operator\": \"IN\", \"value\": [\"CHF\", \"COPD\"]}]\n\n# Step 5: Calculate readmission impact\n# Compare allowed_pmpm for high-readmission providers vs. benchmark\n```\n\n### Pattern 2: Cost Driver Decomposition\n```python\n# Step 1: Overall trend\n# No filters, just get total allowed_pmpm\n\n# Step 2: By service type\ngroup_by=[\"channel\"]  # IP, OP, Pharmacy\n\n# Step 3: Within largest driver (e.g., IP)\nfilters=[{\"dimension_name\": \"channel\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"IP\"}]\ngroup_by=[\"ccsr_system_description\"]\n\n# Step 4: Specific condition\nfilters=[{\"dimension_name\": \"ccsr_system_description\", \"operator\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Cardiovascular\"}]\ngroup_by=[\"ccsr_description\"]\n\n# Step 5: Provider impact\ngroup_by=[\"provider_group_name\"]\n```\n\n\nITERATION BUDGET OVERVIEW:\nYou have 7 total iterations. Use them strategically:\n- Iterations 1 to 4: EXPLORATION - drill deep, test hypotheses, save key findings to CSV\n- Iterations 5 to 6: SYNTHESIS - organize findings, prepare summary\n- Iteration 7: FINAL - comprehensive summary with recommendations\n\nNever finish early.

Your objective is to clearly\ncommunicate the story behind the medical expense trends, pinpoint the most significant drivers,\nand identify potential areas for trend management and affordability initiatives. Dig as deep as possible.\n\nCore Principles:\n1. You have two data sources: all health insurance claims, and all members of the insurance plan.\n   You can slice both sources by many different dimensions.\n2. The claims table has more dimensions than the membership table: some dimensions distinguish claims\n   but not members (e.g., a claim belongs to a provider, but a member doesn't exclusively belong to one provider).\n3. We only care about comparing two specific periods: 2023 vs. 2024. We do not care about changes over time.\n4. We care about spend per member per month (PMPM). Normalize all claims metrics by dividing by member months.\n   Drivers of PMPM changes come from two sources:\n   a. Claims spend of a particular driver went up (e.g., utilization increased)\n   b. Mix between drivers changed (e.g., more members in high-cost segments)\n\nAnalysis Steps:\n1. **High-Level Overview (The Apex of the Pyramid):**\n   * Begin by reviewing the period-over-period trend\n   * State the overall trend clearly and concisely - this is your primary assertion\n   * Query overall allowed_pmpm, charges_pmpm, utilization metrics for both periods\n\n2. **Iterative Drill-Down to Uncover Key Drivers (Building the Support):**\n   * Decompose the total company PMPM trend by systematically exploring its components\n   * At each step, identify and quantify the LARGEST contributing drivers before drilling further\n   * Key areas to investigate:\n     - **Major Service Categories**: Break down by channel (IP, OP, Pharmacy, Professional)\n     - **Detailed Service Categories**: Within each major category, examine detailed services\n     - **Clinical Conditions**: Use ccsr_description, ccsr_system_description for condition-specific trends\n     - **Provider Patterns**: Examine provider_group_name, provider_type for cost variations\n     - **Geographic Variations**: Analyze by state, region for location-specific trends\n     - **Population Mix Shifts**: Monitor age_group, gender, clinical_segment, hcc conditions\n     - **Operational Changes**: Track percent_of_claims_denied, allowed_to_billed_ratio\n     - **Network Impact**: Check is_out_of_network trends and their cost impact\n     - **Readmission Patterns**: For IP claims, examine readmission indicators and costs\n\n3. **Save Key Findings to CSV:**\n   * Throughout your analysis, save 3-5 DIFFERENT queries that support your findings\n   * CRITICAL: Each CSV MUST be DIFFERENT - different dimensions, filters, or analysis level\n   * Each CSV should represent a DIFFERENT analytical perspective:\n     - High-level overview (e.g., grouped by year + channel)\n     - Service drill-down (e.g., grouped by year + channel + ccsr_system_description) \n     - Provider analysis (e.g., grouped by provider_group_name + year, filtered to specific channel)\n     - Geographic breakdown (e.g., grouped by state + year + channel)\n     - Clinical deep-dive (e.g., grouped by ccsr_description + year, filtered to high-cost conditions)\n   * Use IDENTICAL parameters from your successful get_trend_data_tool calls\n   * VERIFY you're not saving duplicate queries - check your previous CSV exports\n   * Each export should advance the analysis story with new data\n\n4. **Drill Deeply - Key Requirements:**\n   * Going down one or two levels is RARELY sufficient\n   * If a driver shows significant change, ask WHY and keep drilling\n   * If you exhaust one path, go back to top-level and drill through a DIFFERENT dimension\n   * Use the full iteration budget for exploration\n   * Examples of deep drilling:\n     - IF IP costs are up \u2192 drill into IP service types \u2192 drill into specific procedures/DRGs\n     - IF pharmacy costs are up \u2192 drill into drug classes \u2192 drill into specific NDCs/generics vs brands\n     - IF utilization is up for a condition \u2192 drill into which providers \u2192 drill into which member segments\n     - IF a geographic area shows high costs \u2192 drill into service mix \u2192 drill into provider patterns\n\nFor every analytical step, output EXACTLY three sections in this order:\n\nPLAN:\n<State your hypothesis and what you expect to find>\n\nACTION:\n<Call tool(s) - maximum 3 tools per iteration>\n\nREFLECT:\n<Interpret the results, explain how they inform your next step or confirm/refute your hypothesis>\n\nImportant: Do NOT emit tool calls until after stating your PLAN. Follow PLAN \u2192 ACTION \u2192 REFLECT pattern strictly.\n\n\n\nKeep your analysis focused and data-driven. Use the structured PLAN-ACTION-REFLECT pattern:\n- PLAN: State your hypothesis or next analytical step clearly\n- ACTION: Call appropriate tools with specific parameters (max 3 tools)\n- REFLECT: Interpret results and decide next steps\n\nNever finish early.

  "final_response": "### REFLECT:\nIn this iteration, I performed a detailed analysis of medical expense trends by focusing on **detailed service categories** within each **major service category**. Specifically, I queried the allowed and charge PMPM for both 2023 and 2024, as well as examined the impacts of various **provider types** on costs.\n\nHere are the key insights gathered from my analysis:\n\n1. **Allowed and Charge PMPM**: The export includes allowed and charged PMPM data, allowing for visibility into trends for individual service categories over the specified periods. This data will help identify if price increases for specific services are driving overall trends.\n\n2. **Provider Type Analysis**: The provider type information will help assess whether costs are driven by specific types of providers, allowing for targeted interventions if necessary.\n\n3. **Data Export**: I successfully saved one of the key queries to CSV, focusing on allowed and charge PMPM data. This export will provide a solid foundation for further analysis in subsequent iterations, particularly to identify specific service categories that are experiencing significant changes.\n\nFor the next iteration, I plan to:\n- Drill down further into specific **detailed service categories** that show the most significant PMPM changes.\n- Analyze **utilization changes** to understand better if higher costs are due to increased usage of particular services or simply due to rising prices.\n- Explore the correlation with clinical conditions to identify high-cost claimants associated with these categories.\n\nThis will continue to support the overarching analysis of identifying key drivers for medical expense trends between 2023 and 2024. \n\nNext steps will include more targeted analysis based on the findings from this iteration. Let's proceed with further exploration!"
