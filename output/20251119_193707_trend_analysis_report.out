### Trend Analysis Summary (2023 vs 2024)

#### Key Findings

1. **Major Service Categories**:
   - Top service categories for 2024 include **Radiology** and **Evaluation & Management**.
   - Significant increases in charges and utilization were noted in both categories, suggesting rising demand or cost structures.

2. **Year-over-Year Comparisons**:
   - Comparative data of service categories indicated shifts in utilization patterns from 2023 to 2024:
     - Radiology and Evaluation & Management showed increased utilization.
     - Notably, specific states (e.g., VA and KY) reported higher costs and usage in these areas, indicating potential areas where healthcare costs are escalating.

3. **Top Conditions**:
   - The most prevalent health conditions included those related to **Diabetes** and **Pneumonia**. Both conditions exhibited rising claim counts and associated costs.
   - There was a marked rise in claims for conditions typically managed through outpatient services, suggesting potentially increased healthcare engagement following service restructuring or patient awareness.

4. **Anomalous Trends**:
   - Some conditions and services showed anomalously high utilization or corresponding costs. 
   - **Pharmacy** claims for Infusion Therapy noted a peculiar spike which warrants further investigation to determine if it was a response to treatment guidelines or a change in patient demographics.

#### CSV Files Generated:
- **[Top service categories by state and year (2024)](output_data/20251119_193646_data.csv)**: Overview of leading service categories for 2024.
- **[Year-over-year comparison of service categories (2023 vs 2024)](output_data/20251119_193651_data.csv)**: Comparison of trends across service categories.
- **[Top conditions by year (2023 vs 2024)](output_data/20251119_193655_data.csv)**: Changes in prevalent health conditions.

### Recommendations

1. **Targeted Cost Management**:
   - Focus on high-cost areas such as radiology and pharmacy for cost-reduction measures, perhaps by negotiating supplier contracts or enhancing preventive care.

2. **Utilization Management**:
   - Monitor rising trend conditions like diabetes closely; implement programs aimed at patient education and management to mitigate escalating costs.

3. **Investigate Anomalies**:
   - Conduct a deeper dive into the significant spikes in certain service areas, especially pharmaceuticals, to understand underlying causes.

4. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - Engage stakeholders, including providers and pharmacy partners, in collaborative discussions around evidenced-based practices that may help curb costs while maintaining quality care.

This analysis can guide further inquiries and operational strategies to address identified healthcare trends effectively.
